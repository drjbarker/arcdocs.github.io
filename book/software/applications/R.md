# R

R is a programming language and software environment initially developed for statistical and graphical computing. It has grown in popularity and is used for a diverse range of research problems.

## Selecting an R version

The default version of R available on ARC3 and ARC4 as a module is R/3.6.1. You can load this module with the command:

```bash
$ module add R
```

However, if you want another version of R you can install it through the conda packagement system included in the Anaconda module. For example to install R/4.0.3 you would do the following:

```bash
# load the anaconda module
$ module load anaconda

# use conda to create an environment in which we install r version 4.0.3, using the conda forge channel
$ conda create -n r4 -c conda-forge r-base=4.0.3

# activate and enter this new environment
$ source activate r4
```

You can then use this version of R as outlined in the rest of this page. For more information on the conda commands used here check the [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-conda).

## Launching on the front end

R can be launched by entering its name at the command prompt; i.e.:

```bash
$ R
```

Please note that this method should not be used apart from for quick
tests. Exit the R console by typing.

```R
q()
```

## Running through an interactive shell

The following will launch R interactively via the batch queues.

```bash
$ qrsh -cwd -V -l h_rt= R 
```

The `<startup_flag>` can be `--save` ,`--no-save` or `--vanilla` . I have used `--vanilla` but information on the meaning of these flags can is [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html).
In the above command, is the length of real-time the shell will exist for. e.g. to run R for 6 hours:

```bash
$ qrsh -cwd -V -l h_rt=6:00:00 R --vanilla
```

This will run R from within the terminal from which it was launched.

## Batch Execution

To run R in batch-mode you must first generate a list of commands for R to process in a file, e.g. [r.in]. You needed to make sure that this file is executable. You can do this by running the command [chmod u+x .sh]. You can check this by running the command `ls -la` and the information for that line will contain an `x` for execute like this `-rwxr--r--`.

A script must then be created that will request resources from the queuing system and launch the R executable; script `runR.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run in current working directory and use current environment
#$ -cwd -V
# Set a 6 hour limit
#$ -l h_rt=6:00:00
#Request more memory, the default is 1Gb
#$ -l h_vmem=1536M
# Load R module
module add R
# run R using command file
# CMD BATCH flag should be given to suppress graphics
R CMD BATCH r.in r.out
```

This can be submitted to the queuing system using:

```bash
$ qsub runR.sh
```

The files for a simple R test example are available to download in this tar file, [R.tar](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/R.tar).

## Installing R packages

Given the large number of R packages available and pace of development, it is preferable that users install the packages they need as opposed to using a centrally provided set of packages.

To install package `foo`, start an R session by entering its name at the command prompt; i.e.:

```bash
$ R
```

and then from within R, install the package:

```R
> install.packages('foo')
```

This will install the package and any dependencies that are required. It will do this by creating a local library (in your home directory by default) where it saves the package binaries and archives. The package should then be accessible from subsequent R interactive sessions and batch jobs.
