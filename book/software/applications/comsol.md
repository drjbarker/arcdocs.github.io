## Accessing the software

To make COMSOL available in your environment, enter the command:

    module load comsol

## Example script

This script will request exclusive access to an entire node.

    #!/bin/bash
    # Run in current working directory with current environment
    #$ -cwd -V

    #change this line for time
    #$ -l h_rt=01:00:00

    #Email on start and end of job
    #$ -m be
    #$ -M <email>@leeds.ac.uk

    #the line below sets the number of cores and nodes
    #$ -l nodes=1

    module load comsol/5.1
    export LM_LICENSE_FILE=<port@server>:$LM_LICENSE_FILE
    comsol batch -np $NSLOTS -tmpdir $TMPDIR -inputfile input.mph -outputfile outphysics.mph -recoverydir /nobackup/$USER/comsolrecovery

In the script above:

Change `<email>` to your
username. For example, if your username is `matzz` :

    #$ -M matzz@leeds.ac.uk

Change `<port@server>` to
the license server details obtained from your Faculty IT support. For
example is you are given `1322@server` :

    export LM_LICENSE_FILE=1322@server:$LM_LICENSE_FILE

## Using batch license

In addition to the default licenses available for COMSOL, additional
batch licenses are available.Â  These can be used by adding an additional
flag to you COMSOL command:

    -usebatchlic

## Managing comsol memory usage while running

Running comsol in command line can often create a large number of
temporary files in the .comsol directory in your home directory
([Details on running comsol in command
line](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=1257)). This can often lead to a
quota exceeded error on jobs.

To resolve this we recommend creating a comsolrecovery directory in your
nobackup and adding the following line to your comsol batch command in
your submission script.

    -recoverydir /nobackup/$USER/comsolrecovery
